# repo-default-branch-not-master (SGA-GL-0006)

## Why it matters

Using a default branch name other than &#39;master&#39; is more collaborative and avoids possible negative historical connotations associated with the term.

## How it works

Change the default branch name in your source control platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to a more inclusive term like &#39;main&#39;, &#39;develop&#39;, or any other preferred name. This can usually be done through the repository settings or by renaming the branch locally and pushing the changes to the remote repository.
