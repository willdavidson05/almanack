## Why it matters

A CODE_OF_CONDUCT file is essential for establishing a respectful and inclusive community within the project. It sets expectations for behavior, helps prevent harassment, and provides a framework for resolving conflicts.

## How it works

Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file in the root directory of your repository. Include guidelines for acceptable behavior, reporting procedures, and any other relevant information. You can use Markdown to format the CODE_OF_CONDUCT file for better readability. For example, you can start with a text editor or use an online Markdown editor to create your CODE_OF_CONDUCT file. Save it as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in the root of your repository. If you&#39;re using GitHub, you can also use their web interface to create and edit the CODE_OF_CONDUCT file directly.
