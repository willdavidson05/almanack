## Why it matters

A LICENSE file is crucial for defining the terms under which the code can be used, modified, and distributed. It helps protect both the authors and users of the code by clarifying legal rights and responsibilities.

## How it works

Create a LICENSE file in the root directory of your repository. Include the text of the license you wish to apply to your code. You can choose from existing open-source licenses, such as MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL, depending on your project&#39;s needs. For example, you can start with a text editor or use an online license generator to create your LICENSE file. Save it as `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` in the root of your repository. If you&#39;re using GitHub, you can also use their web interface to create and edit the LICENSE file directly.
