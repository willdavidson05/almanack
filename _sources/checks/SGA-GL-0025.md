## Why it matters

A valid DOI format is essential for ensuring that the DOI can be resolved and used to reference the work correctly.

## How it works

Ensure that the DOI in the CITATION.cff file follows the standard DOI format, which typically includes a prefix (e.g., 10.1234) and a suffix (e.g., 56789/abcde). The DOI should be in the format: `10.&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;suffix&gt;`. If the DOI is missing or incorrectly formatted, update it to match the correct structure.
