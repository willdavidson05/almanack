## Why it matters

Using issues for tracking bugs and features helps in maintaining a clear record of project development, facilitates collaboration, and allows for better prioritization of tasks.

## How it works

Enable issues on your repository hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) if not already enabled. This can usually be done through the repository settings or by creating an issue template. Encourage contributors to use issues for reporting bugs, suggesting features, and discussing project-related topics.
