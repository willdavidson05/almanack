## Why it matters

An HTTPS resolvable DOI is crucial for ensuring that the DOI can be accessed securely and reliably, allowing users to retrieve the work associated with the DOI.

## How it works

Verify that the DOI in the CITATION.cff file can be resolved using an HTTPS URL. The DOI should be formatted as: `https://doi.org/10.&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;suffix&gt;`. If the DOI is not resolvable or does not use HTTPS, update it to ensure it points to a valid and secure URL.
