## Why it matters

A CONTRIBUTING file is important for guiding potential contributors on how to contribute to the project, including coding standards, pull request guidelines, and other relevant information. It helps maintain a consistent contribution process and encourages community involvement.

## How it works

Create a CONTRIBUTING file in the root directory of your repository. Include guidelines for contributing, such as coding standards, pull request instructions, and any other relevant information. You can use Markdown to format the CONTRIBUTING file for better readability. For example, you can start with a text editor or use an online Markdown editor to create your CONTRIBUTING file. Save it as `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of your repository. If you&#39;re using GitHub, you can also use their web interface to create and edit the CONTRIBUTING file directly.
