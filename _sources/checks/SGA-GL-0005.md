## Why it matters

A CITATION file is important for providing a standardized way to cite the work, making it easier for others to reference and acknowledge the project in their own work. It helps promote the visibility and impact of the project within the academic and research communities.

## How it works

Create a CITATION file in the root directory of your repository. Include information on how to cite the work, such as the authors, title, publication date, and any relevant identifiers (e.g., DOI). You can use the Citation File Format (CFF) standard to structure the CITATION file for better compatibility with citation tools. For example, you can start with a text editor or use an online CFF editor to create your CITATION file. Save it as `CITATION.cff` in the root of your repository. If you&#39;re using GitHub, you can also use their web interface to create and edit the CITATION file directly.
