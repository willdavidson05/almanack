## Why it matters

Including a &#39;docs/&#39; directory with common documentation files helps in maintaining a clear structure for project documentation, making it easier for contributors and users to find relevant information. It also promotes better collaboration and understanding of the project.

## How it works

Create a &#39;docs/&#39; directory in the root of your repository. Inside this directory, include common documentation files such as &#39;index.md&#39;, &#39;CONTRIBUTING.md&#39;, &#39;CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&#39;, and any other relevant documentation files that provide information about the project, its usage, and contribution guidelines. You can use Markdown to format these files for better readability. If you&#39;re using GitHub, you can also use their web interface to create and edit these files directly within the &#39;docs/&#39; directory.
