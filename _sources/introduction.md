# Introduction

Welcome to the Software Gardening Almanack, an open-source handbook of applied guidance and tools for sustainable software development and maintenance.

The Software Gardening Almanack is for anyone who creates or maintains software.
The Almanack instructs individuals - software developers, engineers, project leads, scientists, and beyond - on best nurturing practices to build software that stands the tests of time.
If you've ever wondered why software grows fast only to decay just as quickly, or how to design systems that sustain long-term innovation, this is for you.
This handbook provides pragmatic guidance and tools to cultivate resilient software practices.
Whether you're tending legacy code or planting new ideas, ___jump in and start growing___! üå±

## Overview

The structure of the book includes the following _core chapters_:

1. The [__Garden Lattice__](garden-lattice-intro): a chapter exploring the human-centric elements of software.
1. The [__Software Forest__](software-forest-intro): a chapter examining code and its role in shaping software.
1. The [__Verdant Sundial__](verdant-sundial-intro): a chapter illustrating the evolution of people and code, and their impact on software sustainability.

In addition there are also _supplementary chapters_ which help support or demonstrate the content found within the core chapters:

- The [__Seed Bank__](seed-bank-intro): an applied chapter which illustrates concepts from the Almanack core through Jupyter notebooks.
- The [__Garden Circle__](garden-circle-intro): a space where we openly document principles for developing and maintaining the book as well as document a related application programming interface (API) for the `almanack` Python package.

## Using the Almanack

The [Software Gardening Almanack](https://github.com/software-gardening/almanack) project provides two primary components:

- The __Almanack handbook__: the content found here helps educate, demonstrate, and evolve the concepts of sustainable software development.
- The __`almanack` package__: is a Python package which implements the concepts of the book to help improve software sustainability by generating organized metrics and running linting checks on repositories.

### The `almanack` package

Please see our (Seed Bank)[seed-bank-intro] __Software Gardening Almanack Example__ for a quick demonstration of using the `almanack` Python package.
The package may be installed using the following, for example:

```bash
# install from pypi
pip install almanack

# install directly from source
pip install git+https://github.com/software-gardening/almanack.git
```

Once installed, the Almanack can be used to analyze repositories for sustainable development practices.
Output from the Almanack includes metrics which are defined through `metrics.yml` as a Python dictionary (JSON-compatible) record structure.
Package API documentation may be found within the [package API](package-api) section of the book.

You can use the Almanack package as a command-line interface (CLI):

```bash
# generate a table of metrics based on a repository
almanack table path/to/repository

# perform linting-style checks on a repository
almanack check path/to/repository
```

We provide [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to enable you to run the Almanack as part of your automated checks for developing software projects.
Add the following to your [`pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://pre-commit.com/#2-add-a-pre-commit-configuration) in order to use the Almanack.

For example:

```text
# include this in your pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: https://github.com/software-gardening/almanack
    rev: v0.1.1
    hooks:
    - id: almanack-check
```

## Inspiration

_Software is created, grows, and decays over time._
```

Software experiences development cycles, which accumulate errors over time.
However, these cycles are not well understood nor are they explicitly cultivated with the impacts of time in mind.
Why does software grow quickly only to decay just as fast?
How do software bugs seem to appear in unlikely scenarios?

These cycles follow patterns from life: software is created, grows, decays, and so on (sometimes in surprising or seemingly unpredictable ways).
Software is also connected within a complex system of relationships (similar to the complex ecology of a garden).
The Software Gardening Almanack posits we can understand these software lifecycle patterns and complex relationships in order to build tools which sustain or maintain their development long-term.

> _"The ‚Äòplanetary garden‚Äô is a means of considering ecology as the integration of humanity ‚Äì the gardeners ‚Äì into its smallest spaces._
> _Its guiding philosophy is based on the principle of the ‚Äògarden in motion‚Äô: do the most __for__, the minimum __against__."_
> \- Gilles Cl√©ment

The content within the Software Gardening Almanack is inspired by ecological systems (for example, as in [_planetary gardening_](https://www.architectural-review.com/essays/in-practice/in-practice-gilles-clement-on-the-planetary-garden)).
We also are galvanized by the [_scientific method_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), and [_almanacks_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanack) (or earlier [_menologia rustica_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menologia_rustica)) in documenting, expecting, and optimizing how we plan for time-based changes in agriculture (among other practices and traditions).

The Software Gardening Almanack helps share knowledge on how to cultivate change in order to nurture software (and software practitioners) for long periods of time.
We aspire to define, practice, and continually improve a craft of _software gardening_ to nourish existing or yet-to-be software projects and embrace a more resilient future.

## Motivation

```{figure} assets/xkcd_dependency.png

_We depend on a delicate network of software which changes over time.<br>(Image source: ['Dependency' comic by Randall Munroe, XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2347/))_
```

Our world is surrounded by systems of software which enable and enhance life.
These systems are both invisible and sometimes brittle, breaking in surprising ways (for example, beneath uneven pressures as in the above XKCD comic).
At the same time, [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling) of these software systems also forms the basis of innovation through multidimensional, [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) growth patterns.
We seek to embrace these software systems which are innately in motion, embracing diversity without destroying it to perpetuate discovery and enhance future life.

We suggest reading or using this content however it best makes sense to a reader.
Just as with gardening, sometimes the best thing to do is jump in!
We structure each section in a modular fashion, providing insights with cited prerequisites.
We provide links and other reference materials for further reading where beneficial.
Please let us know how we can improve by [opening GitHub issues](https://github.com/software-gardening/almanack/issues) or [creating new discussion board posts](https://github.com/orgs/software-gardening/discussions) (see our [`contributing.md`](garden-circle/contributing.md) guide for more information)!

## Who's this for?

> _"We'll share stories from the heart. All are welcome here."_
> \- Alexandra Penfold

The Software Gardening Almanack is designed for developers of any kind.
When we say _developers_ here we mean anyone engaging in pursuing their vision towards a goal using software (including scientists, engineers, project leads, managers, etc).
The content will engage readers with pragmatic ideas, keeping the barrier to entry low.
